# Customer-Segmentation

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and grouping customers based on their shopping patterns and behaviors. By leveraging customer data such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score, the model will segment customers into distinct groups. This segmentation will empower mall owners to:

Enhance Targeted Marketing: Tailor marketing efforts to specific customer groups, leading to more effective promotions and campaigns.

Improve Customer Experience: Personalize services and offers to meet the unique needs and preferences of different customer segments.

Optimize Business Operations: Streamline operations and resource allocation based on the characteristics and behaviors of various customer groups.

This project will provide actionable insights that can help mall owners boost customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

## Overview
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing efforts to specific groups of customers, leading to more effective marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction. The analysis is performed using a dataset of mall customers, focusing on identifying distinct groups within the customer base.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains information about customers including their:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

Age: Age of the customer.

Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.

Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.
